Rodent vector icon theme
(c) Fran√ßois Le Clainche <fleclainche at wanadoo.fr> - 2004

This icon theme is released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

NOTES

This is my first icon theme. I made it mainly for fun.
It's still a work in progress.

I'm not an artist, so many icons do not show nice 3D effects.
But I think they are clean and obvious, and that was my main goal.

I did my best to follow the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines :
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/

Are included:
- about 500 icons in SVG format
- all the corresponding copies in PNG format
- almost all icons for a unified Gnome interface (excepted afaict the settings 
  manager, for the time being)
- icons for the Xfce panel version >= 4.1.6 (http://xfce.org)
- a complete alternative theme for Xffm >= 4.1.4 (http://xfce.org)
- alternative icons for the Xfce MCS settings manager, if you are mad enough to
  play with Xfce components at build time. For that, you are on your own. These 
  icons are in the ./48x48/misc/ sub-directory.

INSTALL

- In order to use this icon theme, uncompress the tarball in 
  your ~/.icons or /usr/share/icons directory. But note that 
  this way, "stock" icons won't be used by gtk apps.

STOCK ICONS

If you wanna use the "stock" icons of this theme:
- Uncompress the tarball in your $DATADIR/icons directory
  (usually /usr/share/icons/)
- copy the iconrc file from the current directory to your
  $DATADIR/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/ directory
- add a 'include "iconrc"' line at the begining of your
  /usr/share/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc file
- select your favorite theme

If it fails, check the icons permissions.

XFFM ICONS

To use (permanently) the included xffm theme, copy all icons from the 
./48x48/misc/xffm/ directory to your $DATADIR/icons/Xfce/48x48/stock/ 
directory. You *should* *backup* this directory *before*, or you *will* 
have to *reinstall* xffm to get the previous icons back.

All "fixed" icons will be replaced. Other icons used by xffm are gtk stock icons.
Your current Gtk theme has to use Rodent stock icons (see above) for a unified 
look.

TODO

- draw the small number of missing icons
- clean current svg icons (arrgh!) to make the tarball smaller
- fix size-related problems of the index.theme file and probable other bugs
- understand how stock icons work to avoid the above workaround ?
