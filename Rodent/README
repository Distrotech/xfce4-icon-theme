Rodent vector icon theme
(c) Fran√ßois Le Clainche <fleclainche at wanadoo.fr> - 2004

This icon theme is released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

NOTES

This is my first icon theme. It's still a work in progress.

Icons do not show nice 3D effects. But I think they are clean and 
obvious, and that was my main goal.

I did my best to follow the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines :
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/

Are included:
- about 500 icons in SVG format
- all the corresponding copies in PNG format
- almost all icons for a unified Xfce4/Gtk2 interface

STOCK ICONS

If you wanna use the "stock" icons of this theme:
- copy the iconrc (or the iconrc-png if you don't have svg support) 
  file provided with this theme from the current directory to your 
  $DATADIR/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/iconrc
- if necessary, change the path to the stock icons at the begining of 
  the iconrc file
- add a 'include "iconrc"' line at the begining of your
  /usr/share/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc file
- select your favorite theme
