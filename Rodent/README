Rodent vector icon theme
(c) Fran√ßois Le Clainche <fleclainche at wanadoo.fr> - 2004

This icon theme is released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

NOTES

This is my first icon theme. I made it mainly for fun.
It's still a work in progress.

I'm not an artist, so many icons do not show nice 3D effects.
But I think they are clean and obvious, and that was my main goal.

I did my best to follow the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines :
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/

Are included:
- about 500 icons in SVG format
- all the corresponding copies in PNG format
- almost all icons for a unified Gnome interface (excepted afaict the settings 
  manager, for the time being)
- icons for the Xfce panel version >= 4.1.6 (http://xfce.org)

INSTALL

- In order to use this icon theme, uncompress the tarball in 
  your ~/.icons or /usr/share/icons directory. But note that 
  this way, "stock" icons won't be used by gtk apps.

STOCK ICONS

If you wanna use the "stock" icons of this theme:
- copy the iconrc file from the current directory to your
  $DATADIR/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/ directory
- add a 'include "iconrc"' line at the begining of your
  /usr/share/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc file
- select your favorite theme

TODO

- draw the small number of missing icons
- clean current svg icons (arrgh!) to make the tarball smaller
- fix size-related problems of the index.theme file and probable other bugs
